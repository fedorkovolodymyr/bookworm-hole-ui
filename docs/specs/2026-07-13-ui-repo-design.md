# Bookworm Hole UI — New Repo Design

## Purpose

New standalone frontend repo (`bookworm-hole-ui`) for `bookworm-hole-api`, deployed on Vercel. Progressive delivery in large, logical blocks, each covering one API domain end-to-end (list/detail/create/edit flows for that domain's routers). Final block produces an endpoint audit: which API endpoints the UI actually needs, which existing endpoints are unused/excess, which are missing.

## Stack

| Concern            | Choice                                                                        | Why                                                                                                                                          |

## Design System (Block 0 deliverable)

- Design tokens: color palette (primary/neutral/semantic — success/error/warning), typography scale (font family, sizes, weights), spacing scale, radii, shadows — defined in `tailwind.config` theme, backed by CSS variables for light/dark mode.
- Base components via shadcn/ui CLI: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Card, Dialog/Modal, Dropdown, Avatar, Badge, Toast, Tabs, Skeleton, Pagination.
- Each component gets a Storybook story covering its variants/states (default, disabled, loading, error).
- App shell: header/nav, auth-aware layout, responsive breakpoints.

## Delivery Blocks

Each block = its own spec → plan → implementation cycle (per `writing-plans`/`executing-plans`), building on the previous block's shell and API client.

| #   | Block                 | API routers covered                                           | UI surface                                                                                                                                               |

| 8   | API Audit             | all of the above                                              | Cross-reference every endpoint actually called by the UI against the full API surface; report endpoints to add, change (shape/params), or remove as dead |

Each block after Block 0 follows the same internal shape:

1. `lib/api/<domain>.ts` — typed client functions matching request/response schemas
1. `hooks/use<Domain>.ts` — TanStack Query hooks (queries + mutations, cache invalidation)
1. `components/<domain>/` — presentational components (Storybook-covered)
1. `app/(app)/<domain>/...` — pages wiring hooks + components
1. Vitest/RTL tests per component + hook; Playwright happy-path per block once the flow is navigable end-to-end
1. Update Block 8's running endpoint-usage log with every endpoint consumed this block

## Data Flow & Error Handling

- Axios instance with baseURL from env, `withCredentials: true` for cookie-based auth.
- Response interceptor: on 401, attempt one silent refresh via BFF route, retry original request once, else redirect to login.
- Domain API errors (404/409/422/etc. from the backend's `AppError` shapes) surface through TanStack Query's `error` state; components render inline error states, not global crash boundaries, except for truly unexpected errors (React error boundary at route-segment level).
- Loading states via Query's `isPending`/`isFetching` + Skeleton components from the base kit.

## Testing Strategy

- Vitest + RTL: every base component (Storybook-covered) gets a render/interaction test; every domain hook gets a test against a mocked API (msw) covering success + error branches.
- Playwright: one happy-path e2e per block once wired (e.g. Block 1 → login redirects to catalog; Block 3 → create collection, add book, leave review).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint → type-check → unit/component tests → build → (Playwright on a schedule/PR-label, not every push, to keep CI fast).

## API Audit Deliverable (Block 8)

Produces a table: `endpoint | method | used by (block/page) | status (keep/change/unused)` plus a short list of endpoints the UI needed but the API doesn't yet expose (candidates to add). This becomes the input for a follow-up API-side cleanup pass in `bookworm-hole-api`.

## Out of Scope (this spec)

- Mobile app (native) — not covered.
- i18n — single-locale for now, structure allows adding later (not implemented in Block 0-8).
- Actual Vercel project creation/env config — assumed done manually once repo exists; not part of implementation plan.
